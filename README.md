# The relationship between docker-compose and an ECS task-definition
### What is docker-compose?:

From this tutorial, docker-compose is defined as :

    Docker Compose is a way to create reproducible Docker containers using a config file instead of extremely long Docker commands. By using a structured config file, mistakes are easier to pick up and container interactions are easier to define.

### What is a task definition:

Letâ€™s recall what a task-definition is: it is just a specification. You use it to define one or more containers that you want to run together, along with other details such as environment variables, CPU/memory requirements, etc.

From the two definitions, we can see that a task definition role is similar to that of a docker-compose file.
